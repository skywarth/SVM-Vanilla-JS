# SVM-Vanilla-JS
Just a basic implementation of SVM SMO using vanilla javascript and no ES6. Goal was to find out if it was possible to initiate machine learning algoritmhs without use of ES6,ES8 and many more module based futures. 

SVM SMO javascript algorithm (*/vanillaSVM.js, kernel.js etc.*) is from [node-svm-smo][lib-repo]  library/module thanks to [guihardbastien][the-user].
